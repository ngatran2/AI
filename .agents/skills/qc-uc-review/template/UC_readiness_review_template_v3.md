# UC Readiness Review
**Functional / Black-box Test Readiness Template**

---

> **How to use this template**
>This template defines the minimum information QA testers need to begin test case design.
>Fill out all sections completely before handing off to QA. Do not leave any field blank — if a section truly does not apply, write N/A and explain why.
>
> **Completion status conventions:**
> - ✅ **Complete** = section is fully populated and no longer ambiguous
> - ⚡ **Partial** = contains content but requires further clarification
> - ⚠️ **Missing** = absent — BLOCKER, cannot start test design

---

## 0. Document Metadata

| UC-ID | Feature Name | Version | Status |
|-------|-------------|---------|--------|
| *(e.g., UC-12)* | *(e.g., Service Menu List)* | *(e.g., v1.0)* | *(Draft / In Review / Finalized)* |

| *(Name)* | *(Name & Role)* | *(YYYY-MM-DD)* | *(YYYY-MM-DD)* |

---

## 1. Objective & Scope

### 1.1 Objective
*(Describe WHY this feature exists. What business problem does it solve? Who benefits? Write 1–3 concise sentences.)*

### 1.2 In Scope
*(List every function / sub-use-case covered in this UC. Use one line per item or bullet points.)*

### 1.3 Out of Scope
*(Clearly list what is NOT covered in this UC. If nothing is excluded, write "None.")*

---

## 2. Actors & Stakeholders

| Actor | Type | Role & Permissions |
|-------|------|-------------------|
| *(e.g., Admin User)* | *(Primary / System)* | *(Describe what this actor can do in the UC.)* |
*(Add rows as needed)*

---

## 3. Preconditions & Postconditions

### 3.1 Preconditions
*(List every condition that must be true before the flow begins. One condition per line.)*
- *(e.g., The admin has successfully authenticated.)*

### 3.2 Postconditions
| After completing... | System state / Postcondition |
|--------------------|------------------------------|
| *(e.g., Add record)* | *(e.g., New record appears at the top of the list. Success message is displayed.)* |
*(Add rows as needed)*

---

## 4. UI Object Inventory & Mapping

> **Instructions:** Extract and catalog all user interface components based on the Design Mockup and map them correspondingly to the Functional Specification document.

| Category | Component Name | Description & Constraints |
|----------|----------------|---------------------------|
| **Data Display Structure** | *(e.g., Data Grid / Table)* | *(Identify columns, pagination limit, default sorting logic, and Empty state display.)* |
| **Control System** | *(e.g., Search Bar, Status Dropdown)* | *(Identify initial state, available dropdown values, and input data constraints for search fields.)* |
| **Navigation & Actions** | *(e.g., Save Button, Export Icon)* | *(Define the position and identity of functional buttons on the interface.)* |
| **Other Components** | *(e.g., Tooltips, Breadcrumbs)* | *(Define any other components present on the interface.)* |

---

## 5. Object Attributes & Behavior Definition

> **Instructions:** Determine the state and response of each UI object based on specific system conditions.

| Object / Component | System States | Interaction Matrix | Object Behavior (Data/State Change Context) |
|--------------------|---------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| *(e.g., Save Button)* | *(e.g., Disabled by default until all mandatory fields are filled.)* | *(e.g., Click: Triggers validation & submit. Hover: Shows tooltip.)* | *(e.g., Becomes disabled and shows a spinner while the API request is processing.)* |
| *(e.g., Type Dropdown)* | *(e.g., Enabled. Default value: 'Standard'.)* | *(e.g., Click: Expands list.)* | *(e.g., When changed to 'Custom', the 'Additional Details' text area becomes visible.)* |
*(Add rows as needed)*

---

## 6. Functional Logic & Workflow Decomposition

> **Instructions:** Analyze in detail the business processes of each function available on the feature screen. Duplicate the block below for each major sub-function (e.g., 6.1 View List, 6.2 Create Record).

### 6.1 Function Name: *(e.g., Create New Record)*

**A. Workflows**
| Step | Actor | Action | System Response (Happy Path) | Alternative Flows | Exception & Error Flows |
|------|-------|--------|------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| 1 | *Admin* | *Clicks 'Add' button* | *System opens the creation form.* | *N/A* | *N/A* |
| 2 | *Admin* | *Enters data & clicks 'Save'* | *Data is saved. Popup shows "Success". List refreshes.* | *User clicks 'Cancel': Form closes without saving.* | *Mandatory field empty: Save is blocked, inline error "Field required" shown.* |

**B. Business Rules & Validations**
| Field / Object | Required | Format / Constraint | Min / Max | Error Message *(exact text)* |
|----------------|----------|---------------------|-----------|-------------------------------|
| *(e.g., Name)* | *Yes* | *Alphanumeric only* | *1 / 50* | *"Name is required" / "Max 50 chars"* |

**C. UI/UX Feedback**
* **Loading States:** *(e.g., Spinner on 'Save' button during submission.)*
* **Toast Messages:** *(e.g., Success: "Record created successfully". Error: "Failed to connect to server".)*
* **Error Codes:** *(e.g., Map specific backend error codes to UI messages if applicable.)*

---

## 7. Functional Integration Analysis

> **Instructions:** Analyze and evaluate the linkages and influences between the cataloged functions, acting as an integration check between functions.

| Trigger Function / Action | Impact Analysis (Cross-function influence) | Data Consistency Verification |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| *(e.g., Delete a Parent Category)* | *(e.g., Indirectly affects the 'View List' function: all child items associated with this category must be hidden or reassigned.)* | *(e.g., Verify that the dropdown list in the 'Add Record' form immediately reflects the deletion of the category.)* |
| *(e.g., Change Item Status to Inactive)* | *(e.g., Item can no longer be selected in the reporting module.)* | *(e.g., Verify the dashboard counters update automatically to exclude the inactive item.)* |
*(Add rows as needed)*

---

## 8. Acceptance Criteria

> **Instructions:** Acceptance criteria must be written in a verifiable pass/fail format, using the Given / When / Then structure.

| AC # | Scenario | Given *(precondition)* | When *(user action)* | Then *(expected result)* |
|------|----------|------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| AC-01 | *(e.g., Create - Happy Path)* | *(e.g., Admin is on the Add form with valid data.)* | *(e.g., Admin clicks Save.)* | *(e.g., "Success" message appears. Record is added to the list.)* |
*(Add ACs for every flow and business rule...)*

---

## 9. Non-functional Requirements

| Category | Requirement | Source / Reference |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| *(Performance)* | *(e.g., Search results must load within 2 seconds.)* | *(e.g., SLA doc)* |
| *(Security)* | *(e.g., CSRF protection is enforced.)* | *(e.g., Security policy)* |
| *(Browser Compatibility)* | *(e.g., Chrome, Edge, Safari latest versions.)* | |
*(Add categories as needed)*
