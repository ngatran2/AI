# QC Ask BA Skill

## Purpose

This skill aims to extract unresolved questions identified during the requirement review process (located in the "Unified Gap & Question Report" section of the audited file) and transfer them into a dedicated Question Backlog file. This ensures that Business Analysts (BAs) can easily track, answer, and confirm the missing information.

## Trigger

Execute this skill when the User's prompt matches the pattern: "hãy hỏi BA các câu hỏi của [UC-CAT-ID]" (For example: "hãy hỏi BA các câu hỏi của UC-VOB-001").

## Step 1: Input Resolution & Clone Template

1. Extract the `[UC-CAT-ID]` from the User's prompt.
2. Search for the audited UC file within the `requirements/[UC-ID]/` directory. If multiple versions of the audited file exist, you **MUST select the file with the highest version number**.
3. Read the master template from `skills\qc-ask-ba\template\question-backlog_template.md`.
4. Create the output file at the path: `requirements/[UC-ID]/[UC-ID]_question-backlog.md`.
   - **If the file already exists**: Skip the template cloning process. Only read the existing file and append the new questions. DO NOT overwrite to prevent losing previously answered questions.
   - **If the file does not exist**: Clone the entire content from the master template.

## Step 2: Content Extraction & Transfer

1. From the highest version audited file, extract all the table data under the heading `### 📋 Unified Gap & Question Report`.
2. In the newly created (or opened) `[UC-CAT-ID]_question-backlog.md` file, locate the `## Open Questions` section.
3. Remove the placeholder line `_(No open questions — all resolved.)_` (if it exists).
4. Populate the `Open Questions` table with all the rows extracted from the audited report.
5. Ensure the table columns strictly follow the standard format:
   `| ID | Priority | Ref | Question | Why It Matters | Status |`
6. **ID Handling**: Keep the original IDs (e.g., Q1, Q2) from the audited report unless there is an ID conflict with existing entries in the backlog file (if appending to an existing file).

## Output Contract

- **Output path:** `requirements/[UC-ID]/[UC-ID]_question-backlog.md`
- Once the transfer or merge is completed, output a summary message indicating the number of questions successfully transferred to the backlog file.
